# About the WWU Cybersecurity Club

The goal of the WWU Cybersecurity Club (WWUCSC) is to spread awareness of cybersecurity topics throughout WWU and to create a fun and inclusive space for discussions surrounding cybersecurity.

The WWUCSC holds weekly meetings to discuss news and events, host guest speakers, and present on hot security topics. We also assist one anotheer with our resumes, attend networking events, and stage mock interviews to ensure we all get a running start into the workforce.

Further, the club organizes and competes in various cybersecurity competitions. Notable competitions include:

 - Department of Energy's CyberForce Competition
 - Collegiate Cyber Defence Competition
 - HackTheBox University Capture The Flag Qualifiers
 - NSA's Codebreaker Competition

and many more!
