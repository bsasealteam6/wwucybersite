The goal of the WWU Cybersecurity club is to spread awareness of cybersecurity topics throughout WWU and to create a fun and inclusive space for discussions surrounding cybersecurity. We have weekly meetings to discuss news and monthly topic meetings where an officer or student gives a presentation on a specific topic. We also assist students with resume reviews, networking events, and mock interviews.

We also organize and compete in various cybersecurity competitions. Notable competitions include:
 - Department of Energy's CyberForce Competition
 - Collegiate Cyber Defence Competition
 - HackTheBox University Capture The Flag Qualifiers
 - NSA's Codebreaker Competition
and many more!

This year we're also working on creating an extensive set of documentation surrounding cybersecurity defense. You can see our progress at [docs](/docs/welcome).
